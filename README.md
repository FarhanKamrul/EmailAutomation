# Develop an Open Source E-mail Management Software

So a problem I ran into today was that I–exhausted and overwhelmed with work–functioning on autopilot, sent over an email to a prospective employer without (*gasp*) a subject line. Knowing that this irreconcilable offense could screw me over at any job opportunity, I decided to embark on this project where I shall create a complete email management system for personal use. I might open up this tool for open-source development if I actually go through with it, but this GitHub repository is where I declare my intent.

The first goal is to create a simple Chrome web extension that would either:
- Monitor my emails when writing them to ensure there isn't an empty subject line.
- Use a language learning model to simply write the subject line of the email for me.

The learning path for this is documented as follows:
- Started the [FreeCodeCamp Course on Building a Chrome extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n809nd4Zu4)
  - Roadblocks:
    The prerequisites are Javascript and DOM Manipulation. I have a rudimentary idea of Javascript and how it works, but I don't yet understand DOM Maipulation.
  - Solution:
    [Learn DOM Manipulation]()
