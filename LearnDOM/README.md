This is where I document my journey of learning about Document Object Model (DOM) using Javascript.

##### Time taken: 15 Minutes
##### Learning Resource: [FreeCodeCamp Beginners Guide on DOM Manipulation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-manipulate-the-dom-beginners-guide/)

##### Looking Forward
The goal, looking forward, is to understand DOM manipulation even further while going through the Chrome Extension building process.
