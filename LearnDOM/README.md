This is where I document my journey of learning about Document Object Model (DOM) using Javascript. 

##### Time taken: 
##### Learning Resource: [FreeCodeCamp Beginners Guide on DOM Manipulation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-manipulate-the-dom-beginners-guide/)
##### Looking Forward
The goal, looking forward, is to understand DOM manipulation even further while going through the Chrome Extension building process.

## Overview

DOM, or Document Object Model, is a Javascript programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that a program can manipulate the document structure, style and content.

In this system, the objects within the document (header, body, paragraphs, buttons, etc.) are represented as nodes, enabling Javascript to interact with the page.

The basic DOM tree is represented below:

#### The following topics are covered in the FreeCodeCamp guide
- Event Listeners
- Selecting Elements with DOM
- Traversing the Document with DOM
- Manipulating Elements in the DOM

## Event Listeners

I believe the best way to understand how each of the other systems work is to first understand how event handling works in the DOM.

An *event listener* is basically a function that handles what happens when a particular event happens to an HTML element. For example, what to do when a button is clicked, or what to do if there is input to a text area.
